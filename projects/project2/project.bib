Chapters cover graphical displays, linear algebra, univariate, bivariate and multivariate normal distributions, factor methods, linear regression, discrimination and classification, clustering, time series models, and additional methods. Zelterman uses practical examples from diverse disciplines to welcome readers from a variety of academic specialties. Those with backgrounds in statistics will learn new methods while they review more familiar topics. Chapters include exercises, real data sets, and R implementations. The data are interesting, real-world topics, particularly from health and biology-related contexts. As an example of the approach, the text examines a sample from the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System, discussing both the shortcomings of the data as well as useful analyses. The text avoids theoretical derivations beyond those needed to fully appreciate the methods. Prior experience with R is not necessary. .",

The aim is to use these moments to estimate the mean-squared errors (MSE) for the predicted small area means as a measure of precision. A two stage estimator of MSE is obtained. At the first stage, we derive the MSE when the covariance matrices are known. To obtain an unbiased estimator of the MSE, at the second stage, a method based on parametric bootstrap is  proposed for bias correction and for prediction error that reects the uncertainty when the unknown covariance is replaced by its suitable estimator.",

Featuring applied resources at various levels, the book includes statistical techniques such as t-tests and correlation as well as more advanced procedures such as MANOVA, factor analysis, and structural equation modeling. To promote a more in-depth interpretation of statistical techniques across the sciences, the book surveys some of the technical arguments underlying formulas and equations. Applied Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Statistics also features -Demonstrations of statistical techniques using software packages such as R and SPSS -Examples of hypothetical and real data with subsequent statistical analyses -Historical and philosophical insights into many of the techniques used in modern social science -A companion website that includes further instructional details, additional data sets, solutions to selected exercises, and multiple programming options An ideal textbook for courses in statistics and methodology at the upper- undergraduate and graduate-levels in psychology, political science, biology, sociology, education, economics, communications, law, and survey research, Applied Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Statistics is also a useful reference for practitioners and researchers in their field of application.
